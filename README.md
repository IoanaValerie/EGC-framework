# "Plants vs Zombies" game
Homework for EGC class: https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/egc/teme/2023/01

This project is inspired by “Plants vs Zombies” game and I implemented it with the help of the faculty framework: https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/egc/setup-framework, using OpenGL in Microsoft Visual Studio for the front-end part and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ for the back-end part. This game presents a blend of strategy and action, being based on the interaction with the player, who must defend his grid (home) from the enemies.
